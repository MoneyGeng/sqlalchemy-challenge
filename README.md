## Sqlalcheny and Flask API
Welcome to the Climate Analysis and Flask API repository! This project involved analyzing climate data using Python and SQLAlchemy. The analysis included a precipitation analysis and a station analysis, querying data from a SQLite database. After completing the initial analysis, a Flask API was designed based on the queries developed, creating different routes to access specific data. The API included routes to access precipitation data, stations, temperature observations, and temperature statistics for specified dates.
